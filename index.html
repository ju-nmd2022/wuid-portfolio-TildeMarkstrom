            <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <p>My name is Tilde and I'm 21 year's old.<br/>
        I was born on a sunny day in July, funny enough on my own mothers birthday.
    <p>I took a html class during high school and I really enjoyed it, 
        and I guess that's why I'm studying it today. I've been interested in technology and creating since as long as I can remember,
         and choosing this program felt logical to me.</p>

        <h4>Fun facts about me</h4>
        <p class="ffam">My dad loves anything with technology and his interest 
            has been a huge influence to my interest to tech. When I was born he 
            worked at the cellphone company Sony Ericson, and I don't quite remember
            exactly, but it was a type of signal sender that they had just designed, and
            they said that they would name it after the last born daughter, which was me. So for a couple years I was a part of 
            sony Ericson's cellphones!<br/> He even named me after the pc sign ~ (Tilde)
