            <p>This is a logotype suggestion for the swedish 
                budgie association.<hr/>
                <b>History</b></br/>
                My mother bought her first budgie in 2017, and it was 
                only supposed to be a pet, then she bought another, 
                and another... today in 2022 my mother is one of swedens 
                biggest breeders of budgies. In 2021 she was elected as 
                president of the association. And when I started in this 
                program she asked me to refresh their logo.<hr/>
                <b>Design</b><br/>
                The association wanted to keep the bird and his posture,
                so I traced the original (which was a scanned painting, so
                you can imagine the blurriness), Then I picked the colors 
                after the Pantone color that the budgie is supposed to be.<br/>
                I added a sign under the stick the budgie was sitting on and 
                added their name to it. This Logo is specifically made for large
                print / a large logo. When it's scaled down the name is added 
                next to the budgie, in the same font as on the sign.</p>
