    <h4>My favorite places in jönköping</h4>
    <h5>and why...</h5>

    <a href ="https://jkpg.com/sv/granna/rottle-by/"><p class="place">Röttle By</p></a>
    <p class="why">This is a beatiful place with the old style swedish buildings, the red building with white knots. 
        Once you pass all of the cute houses you'll find the a nature trail with a fun and sometimes a bit challenging terrain. 
        You have the forest on one shoulder and on the other you have a clear view of Vättern. 
        I usually take my parents dog for a walk, which usually takes about two hours. 
        Sometimes we bring fika and sit by the water and in te summers the dogs take a swim.</p>
