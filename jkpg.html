    <h4>My favorite places in jönköping</h4>
    <h5>and why...</h5>

    <a href ="https://jkpg.com/sv/granna/rottle-by/"><p class="place">Röttle By</p></a>
    <p class="why">This is a beatiful place with the old style swedish buildings, the red building with white knots. 
        Once you pass all of the cute houses you'll find the a nature trail with a fun and sometimes a bit challenging terrain. 
        You have the forest on one shoulder and on the other you have a clear view of Vättern. 
        I usually take my parents dog for a walk, which usually takes about two hours. 
        Sometimes we bring fika and sit by the water and in te summers the dogs take a swim.</p>

    <a href ="https://www.naturkartan.se/sv/jonkopings-lan/jarabacken-jonkoping"><p class="place">Järabacken</p></a>
    <p class="why">Järabacken used to be my absolute favorite place when I was little, I lived right below it and used to ski there whenever it was open 
        and when it wasn't me and my friends used to sneak up and go sledding. It may be a small ski slope but it was a blast when you were younger.</p>

    <a href ="https://www.stukjonkoping.se/menu"><p class="place">Stuk</p></a>
    <p class="why">Stuk is a restaurant/café located in the east side of the city core. They have the best pizzas in town and very tasty sandwiches. 
        My first time visting stuk was last summer, it was one of the hotter days so we sat outside with the dogs. I had a pizza with avocado, tomato, 
        hazelnut pesto, arugula, roasted seeds & chives, and I'd rate it 10/10, the best pizza I've ever had. 
        Stuk has a nice atmosphere, it has a scandinavian interior, it feels modern and simple.</p>

    <a href ="http://www.barflamingo.se/"><p class="place">Flamingo</p></a>
    <p class="why">If your looking for a place to have a nice drink in, Flamingo is the place! It's a small bar with a florida style. Whatever drink you want, they'll make it
        and they have a little specials menu with cheaper drinks for each night. It's very cozy and just an overall good bar to start off your night.</p>
